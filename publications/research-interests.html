<h1>
Research Interests</h1>
My research is in two overlapping areas of software engineering:
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
how to build safe systems, and</li>

<li>
how to specify and analyze requirements.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
In the first area, my work focuses on <b>software system safety</b>. In
particular, I am interested in developing safety analysis techniques for
high-integrity product lines. I am also working on architectural analysis
techniques for safety-critical systems. My vision for future research in
this area is detailed in my recent <a href="acm00.ps">survey</a>, ``Software
Engineering for Safety: A Roadmap.''&nbsp;
<p>In the second area, my interest is in <b>modeling and analyzing requirements</b>
for fault detection and recovery. Many of my results in this area have
been applied to NASA spacecraft. Currently, I am also beginning a funded
research project to characterize critical software faults that escape testing
to manifest themselves during flight.
