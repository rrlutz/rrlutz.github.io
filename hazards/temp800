Michelle

We have finally gotten around to reviewing your Object draft. Since we
were not sure exactly where you were going with this, beyond a learning
curve, we weren't sure exactly how to response.  I will give you our
comments as they relate to our Requirements modeling and as we get into
design/code, we will keep you posted on where we are at with objects.

We agreed with the existence of all of you objects except Unusual
Attitude, which is more of a state than an object. One concern was that we
didn't see any decision modeling going on, with a lot of "hard" constant
values specified that are really a function of decisions. We did not go
into a lot of depth related to the content of attributes & behaviours on
all of the objects for that reason.  One a slightly different note, we
would suggest that you not use the terminology "Messages", but talk of
data sources. Using the ADAGE model, all of the inputs to the EFIS come
from the aircraft model, as the highest level of abstraction. Some inputs
come from different subsystems: guidance, navigation...., so the more
abstract you can be in defining the inputs the better. Your use of Pitch
Angle and Roll Angle is better than Attitude/Heading source, since the
later may change in time with new technologies, but the former is the
reality.  Instead of using FCC MODE WD x you could refer to Guidance
subsystem Modes, since when you move to the Raytheon Aircraft the FCC
becomes the FGC (Flight Guidance computer). New architectures will have
new names for these computers, but they are still sources for Guidance
Modes.

If you have any more questions or comments, please reply. We will keep you
in the loop on our OO design.

Dave
