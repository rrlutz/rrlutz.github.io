{\Large\bf Robyn Lutz: Statement of Research} 
\end{center}



My research is in two overlapping areas of software engineering: 
(1) how to build safe systems and (2) how to specify and 
analyze requirements. \\

In the first area, my work focuses on software system safety.
In particular, I am interested in developing safety analysis
techniques for high-integrity product lines.  I am also working
on architectural analysis techniques for safety-critical
systems. My vision for future research in this area is detailed
in my recent survey, ``Software Engineering for Safety:  A Roadmap,''
available on my web page (http://www.cs.iastate.edu/\symbol

In the second area, my interest is in modeling and analyzing
requirements for fault detection and recovery.  Many of my results
in this area have been applied to NASA spacecraft. Currently, I am 
also beginning a funded research project to characterize critical 
software faults that escape testing to manifest themselves during 
flight.
